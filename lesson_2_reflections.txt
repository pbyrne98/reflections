What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Sets up a .git directory to store metadata on your project eg Commit and messages
To tell Git that this directory is a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging holds the files that you want to add to the repository when you finally make a commit.
It allows you to select the files in a working directory that will be monitored by your commits.
It makes it possible to have a working directory that contains WIP files that are related to your project, but not yet ready to include in your repository

Ready for the next question.
